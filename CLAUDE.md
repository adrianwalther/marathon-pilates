## Role Hierarchy

| Role | Who | UID | Access |
|------|-----|-----|--------|
| `owner` | Ruby, Adrian | Ruby: `3a6cd143-6bae-4ba1-8d21-f67d5a50b957` · Adrian: `63323f3e-3215-4264-ae90-bdb1dc4cd602` | Everything incl. revenue |
| `admin` | Jazz, Susan LeGrand | — | Full operations — schedule, users, payroll, CRM. No revenue. |
| `manager` | Front desk / sales staff | — | Schedule view, client check-ins, CRM, time clock (own hours). No payroll, no instructors. |
| `instructor` | Trainers | — | Own schedule + own payroll view only |
| `client` | Studio members | — | Booking, membership, on-demand |

**Important notes:**
- `front_desk` role is fully retired — removed from codebase 2026-05-27. Use `manager` instead.
- Jazz and Susan are **admin**, not manager. Manager = front desk / sales only.
- `owner` role was added to the `user_role` Postgres enum on 2026-05-27.
- Admin-initiated booking (owner/admin/manager books a client into a session from `/admin/schedule`) **is built and live** ✅ 2026-05-28. See `app/api/admin/bookings/route.ts`.

---

## Beta Plan

- **Beta cohort:** Adrian, Ruby, Jazz only — live Stripe, real bookings, minimal data
- **Beta test client account:** `adrianwalther@me.com` (role: client) — use this to QA client-side flows
- **Strategy:** Validate booking flow on web app first. Build native mobile app as next major phase before public launch.
- **Jazz** still needs to sign up at marathon-pilates.vercel.app

## ⚠️ Critical Gotchas (learned the hard way)

### Supabase API keys — NEW format only (legacy JWT keys are DISABLED)
This project has **disabled legacy JWT API keys** (the long `eyJ...` format). You must use the new key format:
- **Publishable** (browser/anon): `sb_publishable_...` → `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- **Secret** (server/service-role): `sb_secret_...` → `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

Symptom of a legacy key: API routes fail with `Legacy API keys are disabled`. Vercel (production) already has the new keys; only local `.env.local` is a risk. When editing `.env.local`, do NOT wrap values in quotes from `.env.pulled` carelessly — verify key prefixes.

### The DB has DRIFTED from the migration files — trust the live DB, not `supabase/migrations/`
Verified 2026-05-28 by querying the live database directly:
- **Migration `002_rls_policies.sql` NEVER applied** — it targets a table named `class_sessions`, but the real table is `scheduled_sessions`. It errored/rolled back.
- Therefore the helper functions `is_staff()`, `is_admin()`, `is_instructor()` **do not exist** in the live DB. Do NOT reference them in new policies.
- The ~63 live RLS policies use an inline idiom instead: `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM profiles WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid() AND profiles.role IN (...))`. Match this pattern.
- Some functions were edited directly in the Supabase SQL editor and never committed back to the repo (e.g. `book_session` had drifted). **Always verify a function/policy against the live DB before assuming the repo `.sql` is accurate.**

### Booking flow architecture
- All bookings are created by **server API routes using the service-role key** (which bypasses RLS): `app/api/bookings/route.ts` (client self-book, credit/comp), `app/api/admin/bookings/route.ts` (staff books a client), `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` (paid booking after checkout). Cancellation goes through `app/api/bookings/cancel/route.ts`.
- `book_session(p_session_id, p_client_id, p_amount_paid, p_payment_status, p_stripe_payment_intent_id, p_credit_id)` RPC: `SECURITY DEFINER`, params have defaults, **no `auth.uid()` guard** (a previous drifted version had one that broke every server booking — fixed 2026-05-28 via `migrations/fix_book_session_service_role.sql`). EXECUTE is locked to `service_role` only. Inside the function, `status` and `payment_status` must be cast to their enum types (`::booking_status`, `::payment_status`).
  - **Credit deduction is atomic inside the RPC** (added 2026-05-28, `migrations/add_credit_deduction_to_book_session.sql`): pass `p_credit_id` and the RPC locks the credit row `FOR UPDATE`, validates ownership + balance, inserts the booking, records `bookings.credit_used = p_credit_id`, and decrements `credits.used_credits` — all in ONE transaction, so a credit can never be double-spent or left un-deducted. Both `api/bookings` and `api/admin/bookings` call the RPC (admin no longer inlines its own insert). The old 5-arg overload was DROPped. Expiry is intentionally NOT enforced inside the RPC (parity with the client-side credit lookup).
- `cancel_booking(p_session_id, p_client_id)` RPC (added 2026-05-28, `migrations/add_cancel_booking_refund.sql`): `SECURITY DEFINER`, `service_role` only. In one transaction it locks the booking, decides late-cancel, flips status to `cancelled`, conditionally refunds the credit, and promotes the earliest waitlisted booking. See **Cancellation policy** below.
- `payment_status` enum includes `credit` (booked via credit/membership) and `included` (complimentary) — added via `migrations/add_payment_status_values.sql`.
- `scheduled_sessions` write policy ("Staff manage sessions", owner+admin) added 2026-05-28 via `migrations/add_scheduled_sessions_write_policy.sql` — without it, staff couldn't add/cancel classes from the UI.
- **Rebook after cancel works** (fixed 2026-05-28, `migrations/fix_rebook_after_cancel.sql`): the table-level `UNIQUE(client_id, session_id)` was swapped for a PARTIAL unique index `bookings_active_client_session_uidx` covering only `status IN ('confirmed','waitlisted')`. Cancelled rows are kept for history and never block a rebook; both API dup-checks filter to active statuses.

### Transactional email (added 2026-05-28 — currently in DRY-RUN until a provider is connected)
All booking touchpoints now send brand-voice emails. Three new files:
- `lib/email.ts` — provider-agnostic `sendEmail()`. Sends via **Resend's REST API** (`fetch`, no SDK dependency). **If `RESEND_API_KEY` is unset → DRY-RUN**: it `console.log`s a `[email:dry-run]` line instead of sending, so flows never break and templates stay inspectable locally. Env vars to go live: `RESEND_API_KEY` + `EMAIL_FROM` (default `Marathon Pilates <hello@marathonpilates.com>`). To switch to Google Workspace SMTP instead, replace ONLY the `fetch` block with a nodemailer transport — nothing else changes.
- `lib/emails/templates.ts` — four templates (HTML + plain text, earth palette, "Move + Restore"/#itsamarathon): booking **confirmed**, **waitlisted**, **cancelled** (3 wordings: refunded / late-cancel forfeit / neutral), **promoted-off-waitlist**. Times formatted in `America/Chicago`.
- `lib/emails/notify.ts` — best-effort orchestration (`notifyBookingConfirmed` / `notifyBookingCancelled` / `notifyWaitlistPromoted`). Loads recipient + class context from the DB and sends. **Never throws** — a failed email can't break a booking/cancel.
- Wired into: `api/bookings` (self-book), `api/admin/bookings` (staff books client), `api/bookings/cancel` (receipt + the promoted-off-waitlist email — closes the gap where auto-promoted clients were never told), `api/webhooks/stripe` (paid booking). Verified 2026-05-28: all 5 emails render correctly through the real `sendEmail` dry-run path.
- **Provider choice is the only launch to-do** (Ruby: Google Workspace vs Resend) — isolated to `lib/email.ts` + two env vars.

### Cancellation policy (📌 PINNED — placeholder, REVISIT with Ruby)
Shipped behavior, all in the `cancel_booking` RPC: **24-hour window. Cancelling 24h+ before start REFUNDS the credit. Cancelling inside 24h on a CONFIRMED booking = LATE cancel → credit is FORFEITED** (the lost credit is the penalty; any $15 cash fee is handled separately). Waitlisted bookings always refund (they never held a confirmed spot). Two knobs, both marked with `>>> POLICY KNOB <<<` comments in the migration: (1) the window — `interval '24 hours'`; (2) forfeit-vs-refund — the `AND NOT v_is_late` guard. Treat as a placeholder we can redo. **Caveat:** bookings created *before* this migration have `credit_used = NULL`, so cancelling them can't auto-refund (we don't know which credit). Verified end-to-end 2026-05-28: both the late-cancel forfeit path and the >24h refund path (`used_credits` round-trips).

### RESOLVED — owners added to the 25 RLS policies (2026-05-28)
25 live RLS policies gated on role but omitted `'owner'` (tables incl. `bookings`, `payroll_periods`, `payroll_line_items`, `instructor_profiles`, `private_session_requests`, `time_entries`, `waitlist_entries`). Fixed via `migrations/add_owner_to_rls_policies.sql` (23 array-form policies patched by a regex `ALTER POLICY` loop + 2 single-value payroll policies rewritten by hand), verified `still_missing_owner = 0`. **Note:** `profiles.role` is the `user_role` ENUM — when editing role lists use a bare `'owner'` literal (Postgres coerces it) or `'owner'::user_role`, NEVER `::text` (mixing text into a `user_role[]` array errors).

## Key Database Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `profiles` | All users + roles |
| `scheduled_sessions` | Calendar classes (both locations) |
| `bookings` | Client bookings — FK is `client_id` (not `user_id`). `credit_used` links the credit spent (for refund on cancel); `late_cancel`/`cancelled_at` track cancellation. Cancelled rows are KEPT for history. |
| `memberships` | Active/past membership records — foreign key is `client_id` |
| `credits` | Group + amenity credit balances |
| `on_demand_classes` | Video library |
| `instructor_payroll` | Pay records per session |
| `client_events` | Append-only behavioral log (service views, nudge shown/clicked/dismissed) powering the "ever-learning" dashboard. Writes ONLY via service-role route `/api/events` (forces `client_id`); no client INSERT policy. Added 2026-05-29. |
| `nudge_copy` | Cache of AI-generated dashboard nudge lines, one per (`client_id`, `service_key`). Service-role writes only; regenerates after 30 days. Added 2026-05-29. |
| `profiles.health_flags` (column) | AI-structured trainer flags (text[]) derived from the client's intake health note; shown on the My Classes roster. `health_conditions` remains the raw source of truth. Added 2026-05-29. |

## Pending Before Launch

- [ ] Reactivate Bunny.net + re-upload 23 videos + re-seed `video_url` in DB
- [ ] Activate Gusto for payroll
- [ ] Confirm amenity pricing with Ruby (sauna, cold plunge, contrast)
- [ ] Connect the email provider — system is BUILT & wired (dry-run); just needs Ruby's provider call (Google Workspace or Resend) + `RESEND_API_KEY`/`EMAIL_FROM` env vars. See "Transactional email" under Gotchas.
- [ ] Point app.marathonpilates.com → Vercel
- [ ] Hero video footage from Ruby (login page left panel)
- [ ] Data migration from Arketa (Susan LeGrand)
- [ ] Rotate all API keys + enable 2FA on launch day
- [ ] Migrate all service accounts to Marathon Pilates business accounts (see HANDOFF/01-ACCOUNT-MIGRATION.md)
- [ ] Finish brand color migration — DONE so far (2026-05-28): (a) exact-match brand hexes (176 across 37 files) → `var(--color-*)` tokens, pixel-identical; (b) off-black `#1A1A1A` (188 across 33 files) → `var(--color-text)` (Deep Earth `#302D27`) — this is a deliberate VISIBLE change (harsh pure-black → warm brand dark). REMAINING (~594): non-brand grays (`#E0E0E0`), Tailwind defaults (`#6B7280` etc.), status-badge tints (red/green/amber), and a few stray darks (`#2A2A2A`, `#333`) — these need design decisions, not a mechanical swap. Note: email templates in `lib/emails/` intentionally keep literal hex (email clients can't read CSS vars).
- [ ] Jazz to sign up at marathon-pilates.vercel.app + set role to admin
- [ ] **Run `add_waiver_consent.sql`** in Supabase (adds waiver_signed_at / waiver_version / waiver_signature). Until then clients still sign (liability_waiver_signed records) but the version/timestamp/signature detail no-ops.
- [ ] 📌 **WAIVER — proofread verbatim (with Ruby) before launch.** The waiver in `lib/waiver.ts` was transcribed from screenshots of the Arketa copy — needs human confirmation it's word-for-word. Specific item: §1 bullet 3 reads "Company' sole discretion" (apostrophe kept exactly as original) — confirm leave verbatim vs. clean to "Company's".
- [ ] 📌 **WAIVER — COVID-19 language refresh (with Ruby).** §1 references COVID-19 / facemasks (the studio's current Arketa wording, kept verbatim). Ruby may want to update/remove it. When the text changes, bump `WAIVER_VERSION` in `lib/waiver.ts` so consent records stay unambiguous.

## Completed (for reference)

- [x] Password reset completed end-to-end — built the missing `/reset-password` page (forgot-password link was a 404) ✅ 2026-05-29
- [x] "Ever-learning" dashboard nudge engine — surfaces a service the client hasn't tried yet (recovery amenities prioritized), in Ruby's brand voice. `lib/nudges.ts` (pure ranker), warm "For You" card on /dashboard ✅ 2026-05-29
- [x] Behavioral learning layer — `client_events` log + `/api/events` route + `lib/events.ts`; nudge ranker boosts services a client keeps viewing (intent) and suppresses dismissed ones ✅ 2026-05-29
- [x] AI nudge copy in Ruby's voice — `/api/nudge-copy` (claude-sonnet-4-6, guardrailed, cached in `nudge_copy`); dashboard renders the static template instantly then swaps to the AI line. Falls back to template on any error/off-spec output ✅ 2026-05-29
- [x] Staff engagement analytics — `/admin/marketing/engagement`: nudge funnel (shown/clicked/dismissed/CTR) per service + recent activity, over `client_events` ✅ 2026-05-29
- [x] Post-cancel rebook modal (retention) — when a client cancels, `components/RebookModal.tsx` offers other upcoming same-type sessions for one-tap rebooking. Books via shared `lib/bookClass.ts`. Logs `rebook_offered`/`rebook_booked` ✅ 2026-05-29
- [x] Fixed "My Bookings" cancel — was a bare status update (no credit refund, no waitlist promotion, no email, wrong 12h window); now uses the `/api/bookings/cancel` RPC like the schedule page (refund + promote + email + 24h) ✅ 2026-05-29
- [x] AI health flags — `/api/health-flags` structures a client's free-text intake note into clean trainer-facing flags (`profiles.health_flags`); My Classes roster shows them as chips. Guardrailed to restate, never advise ✅ 2026-05-29
- [x] Emergency contact added to intake (required name + phone, Step 2) ✅ 2026-05-29
- [x] Liability waiver acknowledgment at intake — full waiver in `lib/waiver.ts` (versioned); Step 3 checkbox + typed signature; records `liability_waiver_signed` + `waiver_signed_at`/`waiver_version`/`waiver_signature` ✅ 2026-05-30
- [x] Lapsed-client win-back worklist — `/admin/marketing/win-back` + `/api/admin/win-back` (staff-auth → service-role aggregate of bookings; lapsed = past visit, none upcoming, quiet N days; enriched w/ membership + unused credits) ✅ 2026-05-30
- [x] Admin-initiated booking (staff books a client into a session) ✅ 2026-05-28
- [x] Recurring weekly schedule generator (`scripts/seed-schedule-recurring.sql`) — DELETE now guarded (future + unbooked only), safe to re-run ✅ 2026-05-28
- [x] Owner added to the 25 RLS policies that omitted it (verified `still_missing_owner = 0`) ✅ 2026-05-28
- [x] Credit deduction folded into `book_session` (atomic — no double-spend / un-deducted credits) ✅ 2026-05-28
- [x] Credit refund on cancel via `cancel_booking` RPC (24h late-cancel forfeit, waitlist promotion) ✅ 2026-05-28
- [x] Rebook-after-cancel fixed (partial unique index on active bookings) ✅ 2026-05-28
- [x] Transactional email system built + wired into all booking touchpoints (dry-run until provider connected) ✅ 2026-05-28
- [x] Fixed `book_session` RPC (was broken for all server bookings incl. paid Stripe) ✅ 2026-05-28
- [x] Added `scheduled_sessions` write policy so staff can add/cancel classes ✅ 2026-05-28
- [x] Security + script audit completed ✅ 2026-05-28
- [x] Owner role implemented end-to-end ✅ 2026-05-27
- [x] `front_desk` role retired + removed from codebase ✅ 2026-05-27
- [x] Manager permissions tightened (no payroll/instructors/social content) ✅ 2026-05-27
- [x] Ruby + Adrian set to `owner` in DB ✅ 2026-05-27
- [x] Adrian's platform email changed to adrian@marathonpilates.com ✅ 2026-05-27

## Important Rules

- **Never change pricing or payroll rates** without confirming with Ruby first
- **Never push to `main` without testing locally** (`cd src/web && npm run dev`)
- **Stripe is in live mode** — real charges happen
- **On Demand is intentionally offline** until Bunny.net is reactivated at launch
- **To disable the beta gate at launch:** remove `BETA_PASSWORD` from Vercel env vars
- **Brand colors:** always use design tokens, never hardcode hex values
- **DB foreign keys:** bookings and memberships use `client_id`, not `user_id`
- **Supabase keys:** new format only (`sb_publishable_` / `sb_secret_`) — legacy `eyJ...` JWT keys are disabled (see Gotchas)
- **Verify DB objects against the live database** before trusting `supabase/migrations/*.sql` — they have drifted (see Gotchas)
